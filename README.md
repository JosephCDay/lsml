Li Song Mechlab (LSML) is a tool for building mech configurations for PGI's MechWarrior: Online. It updates itself from the game files as soon as you update MWO, always fresh data, right at your fingertips!

The tool is still maintained, bugs are fixed, pull requests that meet the contribution requirements are accepted. But no active feature work is ongoing.

If you would be interested in taking over the project and developing new features, start by fixing some of the open issues so we can get to know each other and then file an issue here and we can talk.
