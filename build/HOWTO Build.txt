Here is how you build the nightly/release builds and package them.

1) Open LSML.java and change the version string to include version number if it is a release; Or the date and time of the build in ISO format like so: "(nightly 2013-09-10 20:45)" if it is a nightly build.
2) Right click the LSML project in eclipse and select "Export..." select "Runnable Jar file".
3) Make sure "Launch configuration:" is "ProgramInit - LSML"
4) Make sure "Export destination:" is "LSML/build/lsml_nightly.jar" for nightlies or LSML/build/lsml.jar" for release.
5) Make sure "Library handling:" is "Package required libraries into generated JAR".
6) Click finish.
7) Open launch4j gui and open the "l4j_nightly.xml" file for nightlies or l4j_release.xml for releases.
8) Press the "build wrapper" button (cog wheel).
9) Check in the LSML.java file.
10) Run `candle "LSML Setup.wxs"`.
